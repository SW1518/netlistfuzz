\PARstart{T}{he} algorithm of randomly generating program is the core part of this fuzzer and could be adapted to the generation of the random netlists. In this project, the hardware description language Verilog is the design specification file of the random netlist. Verilog is traditionally used by hardware synthesis software to represent logic networks (logic-level hierarchical circuit in textual form). A standard \cite{1620780} presented by IEEE described the specific definition of Verilog, the circuit was regarded as a directed graph of combinational logic nodes and sequential logic elements. Models, Logical gates and Latches were main components of a Verilog file.
\section{Developing environment and tools}
As compiling based project, the first step is to decide the developing environment. For the DUT: Berkeley designed ABC and existing testing tool VlogHammer, these are all Linux software. Developing this project in a open source way can gather more people's brilliant idea and intelligence. The \texttt{Readme.txt} on Github of ABC shows that current version of ABC has been tested stable on current Linux distribution version in 32-bit and 64-bit. Considering above factors, this project was developed on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS.

Compile language of this project is selected as C++ due to its Object-oriented feature. As a popular  integrated development environment (IDE) on Linux  Visual Code on Linux system
