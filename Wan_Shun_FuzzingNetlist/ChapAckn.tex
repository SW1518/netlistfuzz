First, I would like to express my grateful thanks to my supervisor Dr.John Wickerson for his kind guidance through this academic year. His erudite knowledge and open-mind inspire me during this individual project and even in future academic research. More importantly, he taught me the critical and analytic thinking would benefit me through my life. I am grateful and fortunate to develop this MSc project under his supervision.

With the kind help of the academic staff of Berkeley University, Alan Mischchenko, this project achieve more effective implementations and innovative functions. He generously shared his brilliant idea and thoughts. He programmed SIS and ABC are DUTs in this project. I would also like to thank Mr. Trevor Williams, who discusses Verlog code coverage with me.

Besides, I would like to thank all my MSc colleague in the department. The communications with them opened my mind and enriched my college life.

I would also like to thank my parents, who always support me throughout my life.
